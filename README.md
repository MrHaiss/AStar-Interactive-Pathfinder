# AStar Interactive Pathfinder
 A* is a pathfinding algorithm that's used to calculate the most efficient path to take between two points. This app takes in user input to set a start and end point and then to build a maze of objects. 

Uses tkinter to handle the dialog boxes for user input and pygame to display the grid. User input is validated using regex. The calculations of the alogrithm are displayed in real-time (users can see the path being drawn).
